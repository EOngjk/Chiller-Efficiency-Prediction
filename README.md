# Chiller-Efficiency-Prediction
This project uses machine learning techniques to leverage the operational data collected Chillers to maximise chiller efficiency, by predicting the Coefficient of Performance and cooling load needed based on the user inputs. A dashboard is developed using Streamlit to enhance decision making.
